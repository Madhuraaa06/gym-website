Transitioning your static HTML and CSS files into a functional React website involves several steps. Here's a simplified guide to help you get started:

1. **Set Up Your React Project:**
   - Install Node.js: If you haven't already, install Node.js from the official website (https://nodejs.org/). This will also install npm, the Node Package Manager.

   - Create a React App: Open your terminal and run the following command to create a new React app using Create React App (CRA):
     ```
     npx create-react-app gym-website
     ```
     Replace "gym-website" with your desired project name.

   - Navigate to your project folder:
     ```
     cd gym-website
     ```

2. **Organize Your Files:**
   - Place your HTML files in the `public` directory.

   - Place your CSS files in the `src` directory, typically in a folder like `src/css`.

3. **Componentize Your Website:**
   - Create React components for each page of your website (Home, About Us, Contact, Pricing, Gallery).

   - In the `src` directory, create a folder called `components`.

   - Inside the `components` folder, create a component file for each page. For example, `Home.js`, `About.js`, `Contact.js`, `Pricing.js`, and `Gallery.js`.

   - Copy the relevant HTML content from your static HTML files into these React component files. Convert the HTML into JSX syntax.

   - Import and use these components in your main `App.js` file.

4. **Routing:**
   - Install `react-router-dom` to handle routing in your app:
     ```
     npm install react-router-dom
     ```

   - Set up routes in your `App.js` file using `BrowserRouter`, `Route`, and `Switch` components from `react-router-dom`.

5. **Styles:**
   - Import your CSS files into your React components where needed.

   - Consider using CSS modules or a CSS-in-JS library (like styled-components or Emotion) for better styling management within React components.

6. **Testing:**
   - Continuously test your application by running `npm start` in your project folder. This command starts the development server and opens your app in a browser.

7. **Functionality:**
   - Add any required functionality to your components. For example, if you have a contact form, you'll need to implement form handling using React state or a state management library like Redux.

8. **Optimization:**
   - Optimize your React app for production using `npm run build`. This will create an optimized production build of your app in the `build` directory.

9. **Deployment:**
   - Choose a hosting platform for your React app (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, AWS, or Firebase).

   - Follow the deployment instructions for your chosen platform to host your React app.

10. **Testing and Debugging:**
    - Thoroughly test your React website, both locally and after deployment, to ensure all features and functionality work as expected.

11. **Maintenance and Updates:**
    - Continue to maintain and update your React app as needed, adding new features or making improvements.

Remember that this process can be more complex depending on the complexity of your original static website. It's essential to have a solid understanding of React and its ecosystem to effectively convert your static site into a dynamic, functional React app. Additionally, you may need to adapt or rewrite some parts of your HTML and CSS to fit the React component structure and JSX syntax.
